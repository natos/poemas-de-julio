      <title>Surprising Reasons NYC Startups Are Topping Silicon Valley</title>

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was seated at a café in Silicon Valley speaking to the founder of an early-stage enterprise software company, when we got to the nut of the conversation: he was raising money. The problem was: he was raising $4m at a $10m pre-money valuation, for a $14m post-money, for a company with eleven clients on pilot contracts paying under $2,000 per month, in several cases under $1,000 (&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the valuation, and the estimation of potential scale, was so far out of whack with current market realities as to be grotesque, and it is this growing factor that makes New York and mid-Atlantic region companies increasingly superior investment opportunities to those in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Who Are Some of the VCs You Should Pitch When You Fundraise?</title>

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have the resources to take your company to the next phase of product development and growth, your company is dead in the water. I’ve previously written about the seed fundraising process here, and the Series A fundraising process here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancillary benefit of fundraising is that you learn a ton about your own business, your industry, your business model and the talent market by having conversations with great VCs. Entrepreneurs need to realize that fundraising isn’t JUST about you getting money for your business – it’s about you learning and gaining valuable intel that you can apply as you operate your company day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I pitched hundreds of investors – individual angels and institutions – in the process of raising our seed, A and B rounds for Scripted.  Here is a list of some of the institutional investors that I learned the most from during the fundraising process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goo.gl/yqGi7R&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blogs-images.forbes.com/amyguttman/files/2016/02/unnamed-12-1200x900.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Founder Brian Pallas with Opportunity Network team Credit: Opportunity Network&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur Brian Pallas has managed to achieve the stuff of founders’ dreams. His startup, Opportunity Network is valued at $150m, and the 28-year old hasn’t taken a penny of venture capital. Just last year, when I first reported about Pallas’ success, ON was valued at $100m&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, venture capital has become a dominant force in the financing of innovative American companies. From Google to Intel to FedEx, companies supported by venture capital have profoundly changed the U.S. economy. Despite the young age of the venture capital industry, a fifth of current public U.S. companies received venture capital financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, How much does it drive U.S. Economy?&lt;/p&gt;
